# cluster-prime

MagPi tutorial on building a simple supercomputer cluster.

See MagPi #87 for full details and instructions.

<https://raspberrypi.org/magpi/>

Also included is an alternative version, prime-blinkt.py. This uses
Pimoroni's Blinkt! LED array to display a colourful counter as each
node in the cluster does its work. The payoff is that updating the display
has a significant detrimental effect on the speed of the processing, but hey,
it's pretty.

To use the Blinkt! version, make sure you have the Blinkt! drivers installed.
See <https://learn.pimoroni.com/tutorial/sandyj/getting-started-with-blinkt> for
instructions. Otherwise, use identically to prime.py.
